<h2>Project: SPIWUP (Alex)<br><sup>Seizure Pattern Identification, Warning, and Ultimate Prevention</sup></h2>
<br>
<h3>What is "Project: Alex?"</h3>
<p><i>Project: Alex</i> was spearheaded by Evan Jensen, founder, owner, and lead-developer at Smashstar Media to directly benefit consumers, specifically those with seizure-related disorders, with the ultimate goal of being able to identify disorders, warn of oncoming attacks/episodes, provide as much data as possible to neurologists and contributing third-parties, and ultimately help to prevent the symptoms related to the respective disorders.</p>
