<h1>Project: SPIWUP (Alex)<br><sup>Seizure Pattern Identification, Warning, and Ultimate Prevention</sup><br>
  <sup><sub><b>Platform:</b> iOS, watchOS, Android; &nbsp; <b>Language:</b> Python, Swift, Java;</sub></sup></h1>
<br>
<h2>What is <i>Project: Alex</i>?</h2>
<p><i>Project: Alex</i> was spearheaded by Evan Jensen, founder, owner, and lead-developer at Smashstar Media to directly benefit consumers, specifically those with seizure-related disorders, with the ultimate goal of being able to identify disorders, warn of oncoming attacks/episodes, provide as much data as possible to neurologists and contributing third-parties, and ultimately help to prevent the symptoms related to the respective disorders.</p>
<br>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build an app to collect as much biometric/environment data as possible before, during, and after attacks/episodes</li>
  <li>Compile data into meaningful metrics that can benefit neurologists, scientists, and patients</li>
  <li>Privately and securly analyze data to properly identify syptoms and conditions during an attack/episode</li>
  <li>Build an AI alerting system that monitors biometric.environment variables and predicts attacks/episodes</li>
  <li>Integrate an alerting system for patients that may need immediate/emergency attention for family members and EMS</li>
  <li>Integrate with OS-level systems (core location, telemetry, etc) to optimize efficiency of EMS and ER personnel</li>
</ul>
